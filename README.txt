PY-RELEASE

A drop-in solution for managing Python package releases across multiple platforms:
- ✅ GitHub releases (tested and working)
- ✅ PyPI releases (tested and working)
- 🚧 APT packages (not implemented)
- 🚧 Homebrew formulas (in progress)

Supports both local execution and GitHub Actions workflows.

1. INSTALLATION

   1.1 Copy the py-release directory to your project root
   1.2 Run the setup script:
       ./py-release/setup # will install dependencies if not available [deps]

2. CONCEPTS

2.1 Release Targets
    There are two distinct target types:
    - Push targets:
      ✅ github: Create releases with assets and notes
      ✅ pypi: Build and publish Python packages
    - Pull targets:
      🚧 apt: Generate and maintain debian packages
      🚧 brew: Generate and maintain Homebrew formulas

2.2 Release Steps
    Each target follows these steps in sequence:
    
    build  → Generate required artifacts
            - PyPI: Build distribution files
            - GitHub: Prepare release notes and assets
            - APT: Generate debian package
            - Brew: Generate formula file
    
    check  → Test locally before publishing
            - PyPI: Install from local dist
            - GitHub: Validate release assets
            - APT: Install local package
            - Brew: Install local formula
    
    publish→ Make changes available
            - PyPI: Upload to PyPI
            - GitHub: Create release
            - APT: Commit package to repo
            - Brew: Commit formula to repo
    
    verify → Test as end user
            - PyPI: Install from PyPI
            - GitHub: Check release via API
            - APT: Install via apt
            - Brew: Install via brew

3. USAGE

3.1 The new-release command
    By default runs all steps for all targets using GitHub Actions:
    
    ./py-release/new-release

    Options:
    --target=<target>     Specify target (pypi,apt,brew,github)
    --local              Run locally instead of GitHub Actions
    --build             Run until build step
    --check             Run until check step
    --publish           Run until publish step
    --verify            Run all steps (default)
    --force             Force update even if no changes
    --version=<ver>     Override version
    --package-name=<n>  Override package name

    Examples:
    ./py-release/new-release --target=brew --check --local
    ./py-release/new-release --target=pypi --publish
    PACKAGE_NAME=foo ./py-release/new-release --target=apt

3.2 Direct Target Scripts
    Each target has individual scripts for each step:
    
    ./py-release/pypi/build   # Build PyPI package
    ./py-release/apt/check    # Test APT package
    ./py-release/brew/publish # Commit Brew formula
    ./py-release/github/verify# Verify GitHub release
